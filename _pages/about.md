My name is Michael and I'm an information security student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm interested in malware research, red teaming, reverse engineering, programming, and [edtech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology) in cybersecurity.

This blog is a summation of some of my thoughts and some projects that I'm working on. I hope that you find something here that's interesting, or at least useful.
